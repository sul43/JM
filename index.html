<h1>Jebamoni (PAKHI)</h1>
<h3>I know a girl who is extremely beautiful, cute, and pretty—no words are enough to describe her! And her eyes? MashaAllah! Allah has made them so beautiful that it leaves me in awe. Do you know who she is? Of course, she is <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jebamoni__?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw==">JEBAMONI</a>(Pakhi).<p>

</p>I’ve known her for a long time, but we started talking exactly 324 days ago—nearly a year now. When I first saw her, I thought to myself, 'How can a child be this beautiful!' But later I found out she is actually older than me. So, I probably shouldn't call her a 'child' anymore, right? But it doesn't matter; to me, she is still as innocent and sweet as one. Jebamoni can be a bit short-tempered at times, but she has a heart of gold.</h3>
